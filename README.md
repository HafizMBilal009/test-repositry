# Git Assignment
My first assignment to have a grip on some basic **git** commands.

I have learnt:
* how to initialize a repositry
* how to clone a remote repositry
* how to create a new branch
* how to jump to an existing branch
* how to add files to staging area
* how to commit changes
* how to push code to remote repositry


The links from where I've learnt git commands are:
